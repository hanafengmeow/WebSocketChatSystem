      "The deal includes the release of all hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, as well as an initial pullback by the Israeli military in Gaza.",
      "This is a deliberately very long chat message designed to test the systemâ€™s ability to handle near-maximum payload size. By pushing closer to 500 characters, we ensure both serialization and transmission layers are exercised. If this goes through without issues, we know the server and client can handle stress at the upper message size boundary.",
      "Sometimes developers underestimate the importance of stress-testing with realistic but long messages. In real systems, messages may include logs, URLs, stack traces, or long chat paragraphs. This example is inserted here to simulate such scenarios and confirm the system behaves correctly under conditions close to maximum message length as required.",
